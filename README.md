## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- TailWind CSS

### What I learned

I learnt how to change the display size of the website for desktop and mobile separately and customize them as need for the two screens. This was done by using @media element of CSS
Further, I also learnt how to add an Image in a box element using div

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  div.box {
    margin: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    display: block;
  }
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue my focus on writing better CSS and also incorporate TailWindcss in my future learnings

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me is clearing my understanding of CSS syntax and elements
